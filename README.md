# 3d-resume

## About
After getting very tired of using my normal pdf resume for everything, I decided that it would be a bit more fun to make a 3D scene to display my resume. It was a great project to practice using React Three Fiber. I learned a lot about utilizing Drei components and developed a great appreciation for everybody in the community who adds to the library.
